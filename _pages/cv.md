Experience
======
* **Student Researcher** <br> **New York University**, New York · June 2025 - Present
  * LLM-driven Agent-Based Modeling: Developed a simulation framework using LLMs to generate synthetic user personas from environmental data and differentially-private individual trajectories. This approach models micro-level economic decision-making and provides a novel benchmark against traditional agent-based models.
  * Time-Series Representation Learning: Investigated the role of adaptive masking in eliminating data redundancy for time-series forecasting. This research led to a dynamic masking loss framework with representation consistency constraints that challenged conventional long-sequence information hypotheses and significantly improved prediction accuracy.
  * Advanced Positional Encoding: Researched and developed novel positional encoding methods to enhance the representation of high-dimensional data within neural network architectures, leading to a proposed Generalized ROPE for n-dimensional position embedding.

* **Undergraduate Researcher** <br> **Dalian Jiaotong University**, Dalian · Dec 2022 - July 2024
  * Led a 5-member multidisciplinary team to develop a first-place award-winning autonomous vehicle system, integrating Mecanum wheel chassis, custom PCB with NXP RT1064 microcontroller, MobileNetV2-based computer vision, and robotic arm automation for intelligent objective sorting and storage tasks.

* **Full-stack Developer** <br> **SnowFox Tech Co., Ltd.** · Nov 2022 - June 2023
  * Developed a real-time motion capture system with sensor fusion firmware, 3D biomechanical analytics, and edge-deployed machine learning.
