In the space between thought and code lies something worth exploring

I'm interested in the fundamental questions of intelligence—how machines can learn to understand, reason, and interact with the world around them. My work sits at the intersection of language, learning, and time, exploring what happens when we push the boundaries of what's computationally possible.

Currently pursuing research that bridges theoretical foundations with practical applications, I find myself drawn to problems that challenge our assumptions about how intelligent systems should be built. There's something compelling about working at the edges of what we know, where the maps we've drawn begin to fade and something new might emerge.

## Current Directions

The questions I'm exploring evolve around core problems in machine learning and artificial intelligence:

- **Representation Learning**: How do we capture the essential patterns in complex, sequential data while avoiding the noise that often clouds our models?
- **Reasoning and Planning**: What happens when we try to give machines the ability to think through problems not just statistically, but strategically?
- **Language and Understanding**: How might we build systems that don't just process text, but begin to grasp something closer to meaning?

These aren't just technical puzzles—they're questions about the nature of intelligence itself, about what it means for something to truly understand rather than simply recognize patterns.

## Recent Work

Some of our recent explorations have focused on adaptive approaches to time series analysis, questioning whether the conventional wisdom about information retention actually serves us well. Sometimes the most interesting discoveries come from questioning the assumptions we've carried forward simply because they seemed reasonable.

There's also work on the computational side—thinking about how we might build agents that can navigate complex, dynamic environments while maintaining some coherent notion of their own capabilities and limitations.

## Beyond the Lab

The best ideas often come from unexpected places. When I'm not thinking about algorithms, you might find me exploring the intricate systems within video games, experimenting in the kitchen where precision meets creativity, or listening to classical music—another form of complex information flowing through time, full of patterns and surprises.

These different kinds of problem-solving feed back into each other. The way you approach a challenging level in a game, or work through a complicated piece of music, or troubleshoot a failed recipe—it's all connected to how we think about building systems that can navigate uncertainty and complexity.

## Looking Forward

I'm searching for opportunities to collaborate with others who see these fundamental questions as worth pursuing, wherever they might lead. The most interesting work happens when we're willing to let go of our preconceptions and see what the problem itself is trying to tell us.
